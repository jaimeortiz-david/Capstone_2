# Capstone_2
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques my objective is to understand the relationships between scientific research and conservation management goals.
## Dataset
The scientific text data was obtained from the “Data for Research” service provided by JSTOR (h​ ttp://dfr.jstor.org)​ using the following search string: [“Galapagos” OR “Galápagos”]. This first search produced more than ten thousand articles; this result was then refined to full-length journal research articles only and English language resulting in a total of 3,717 articles dated from 1812 to 2015. The grey literature sample was obtained by digitizing the available management plans for the region and the protected areas of the Galapagos Islands, nine in total (1974, 1984, 1988, 1996, 1999, 2005, 2007, 2014, 2015). Another set of grey literature “Galapagos Report” (http://www.galapagos.org/about_galapagos/about-galapagos/library/galapagos-reports/), is composed by a set of articles (in this analysis the publications since 2008 were used) written by different actors in the Galapagos environmental governance (i.e. researchers, protected area managers, urban planners, natural science students, conservationists). The final data set is composed by another scientific laden literature, the CDF journal (1964-2010) (http://www.darwinfoundation.org). This set of data differs from the international scientific articles in two ways: 1) the journal was aimed to a very specific public concerned with the conservation and scientific research in the Galapagos Islands; and 2) the content, at least, in the beginning of the journal included a summary of news deemed relevant for this public.
